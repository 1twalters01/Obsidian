**Verification of a product** shows:
* Proof of compliance with requirements
* That the product can meet each "shall" statement as proven through:
	* Performance of a test, analysis, inspection, or demonstration (or combination of these)

**Validation of a product** shows:
* That the product accomplishes the intended purpose in the intended environment
* That it meets the expectations of the customer and other stakeholders as shown through:
	* Performance of a test, analysis, inspection, or demonstration

**Verification testing** relates to the approved requirements set and can be performed at different stages in the product life cycle.
The approved specifications, drawings, parts lists, and other configuration documentation establish the configuration baseline of that product, which may have to be modified later
* Later modifications could be costly or cause major performance problems without a verfied baseline and appropriate configuration controls

**Validation** relates to the ConOps document.
* Validation testing is conducted under realistic (or simulated) conditions on end products for the purpose of determining the effectiveness and suitability of the product for use in mission operations by typical users.
* Validation can be performed in each development phase using phase products (e.g., models) and not only at delivery using end products

Verification and validation methods can differ between phases as designs advance
Success of a program or project may relate to the frequency and diligence of validation during design process
* Especially in **pre-phase A** and **phase A** where corrections in the direction of product design might still be made cost-effectively

Continually ask yourself "Are we building the right product for our users and other stakeholders?"
