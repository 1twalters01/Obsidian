This chapter provides the application context of the 17 common technical processes required in NPR 7123.1, NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements. There are three sets of common technical processes here:
* System design - chapter 4.0
* Product realization - chapter 5.0
* Technical management - chapter 6.0

The processes of the SE engine are used to develop and realize the end products.
* Processes 1 through 9 indicated in the image below represent the tasks in the execution of a project.
* Processes 10 through 17 are crosscutting tools for carrying out the processes

The four **system design processes** are used to:
1) Define and baseline stakeholder expectations
2) Define and baseline the technical requirements
3) Convert the requirements into a design solution that will satisfy the baselined stakeholder expectations
* These processes are applied to each product of a system structure from the top of the structure to the bottom until the lowest products in any system structure branch are defined to the point where they can be built, bought, or reused.
* All other products in the system structure are realised by implementation or integration

The **product realisation processes** are used to:
1) create the design solution for each product
2) to verify, validate, and transition products that satisfy their design solutions and meet stakeholder expectations as a function of the applicable life cycle phase up to the next hierarchical level.
* These are applied to each operational/mission product in the system structure starting from the lowest level product and working up to higher level integrated products

The **technical management processes** are used to:
1) Establish and evolve technical plans for the project
2) Manage communication across interfaces
3) Assess progress against the plans and requirements for the system products or services
4) Control technical execution of the project through to completion
5) Aid in the decision-making process

These processes are used both iteratively and recursively to break down the inintializing concepts of the system to a level of detail concrete enough be implemented on a product.

**Iterative** - the application of a process to the same product or set of products to correct a discovered discrepancy or other variation from requirements.

**Recursive** - adding value to the system by the repeated application of processes to design next lower layer system products or to realise next upper layer end products within the system structure
* This also applies to repeating application of the same processes to the system structure in the next life cycle phase to mature the system definition and satisfy phase success criteria
