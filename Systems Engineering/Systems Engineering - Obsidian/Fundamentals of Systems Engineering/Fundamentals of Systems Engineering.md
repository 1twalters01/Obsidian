**Systems Engineering** - a methodical, multi-disciplinary approach for the design, realization, technical management, operations, and retirement of a system.
* A way of achieving stakeholder functional, physical, and operational performance requirements in the intended use environment over the planned life of the system within often opposed constraints, e.g. cost and schedule.
* A methodology that supports the containment of the lifecycle cost of a system.

**System** - the combination of elements that function together to produce the capability required to meet a need. AKA it is the **big picture**
* Value added to the system, beyond the individual parts, is mainly from the how the parts are interconnected

**Elements** - includes all hardware, software, equipment, facilities, personnel, processes, and procedures needed to produce system level results.
Results include:
* System-level qualities, properties, characteristics, functions, behaviour, and performance.

The contributions of various disciplines e.g. electrical engineers, structural engineers, power engineers, etc. are evaluated and balanced, one against another, to produce a coherent whole that is not dominated by the perspective of a single discipline.

The systems engineer:
* Oversees, directs, communicates, monitors, and coordinates tasks between different teams.
* Reviews and evaluates the technical aspects of the project to ensure that the system/subsystem engineering processes are functioning properly and evolves the system from concept to product.
* Usually does many tasks, including but not limited to:
	* playing a key role in leading the development of the concept of operations (ConOps) and resulting system architecture
	* defining boundaries and allocating requirements
	* evaluating design trade-offs, and balancing technical risk between systems
	* defining and assessing interfaces
	* providing oversight of verification and validation activities

The three main objectives of managing a project are:
1) Managing the technical aspects of the project
2) Managing the project team
3) Managing the cost and schedule
* These three functions are often interrelated

## Key takeaways
* Systems engineering is about trade-offs and compromises between different teams in a project
* It plans the life of the system within often opposed constraints
* They manage various things, have many roles, and need to have a big picture view of the project
