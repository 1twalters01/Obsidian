# Scope and depth
* Describes systems engineering best practices that should be incorporated in the development and implementation of both large and small projects.
* Systems Engineering requires a systematic and disciplined set of processes
	* 17 processes are described in the NASA systems engineering handbook.
	* These are applied recursively and iteratively throughout the lifecycle of the programs and projects.
	* Main stages of a project are:
		* design
		* development
		* operation
		* maintenance
		* closeout
