The objective of systems engineering is to see that the system is designed, built, and can be operated so that it accomplishes its purpose safely in the most cost-effective way possible considering performance, cost, schedule, and risk.
* This causality is an indefinite one as there are usually many designs that meet the cost-effective condition

At each cost-effective solution:
* To reduce cost at constant risk, performance must be reduced
* To reduce risk at constant cost, performance must be reduced
* To reduce cost at constant performance, higher risks must be accepted
* To reduce risk at constant performance, higher costs must be accepted
* In this context, time in the schedule is often a critical resource, so that schedule behaves like a kind of cost

* The image below shows that the life cycle costs of a program or project tend to get "locked in" early in design and development
* Later identification and fixes to problems cost considerably more later in the lifecycle
* Conversely, descopes taken later versus earlier in the project lifecycle result in reduced cost savings
* Numbers will vary from project to project, but the general shape of the curves and the message they send will be similar

The way the system is designed will determine how expensive it will be to test, manufacture, integrate, operate, and sustain, hence the high committed lifecycle cost.
