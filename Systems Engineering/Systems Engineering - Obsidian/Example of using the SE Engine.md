# Pre-Phase A
The SE engine is used to:
1) Develop the initial concepts
2) Clearly define the unique roles of humans, hardware and software in performing the missions objectives
3) Establish the system functional and performance boundaries
4) Develop/identify a preliminary/draft set of key high-level requirements
5) Define one or more initial Concept of Operations (ConOps) scenarios
6) Realise these concepts through iterative modelling, mock-ups, simulation, or other means
7) Verify and validate that these concepts and products would be able to meet the key high-level requirements and ConOps.
* The operational concept must include scenarios for all significant operational situations, including known off-nominal situations
* Important malfunctions and degraded-mode operational situations must be considered
* **Early ConOps is important** as it gets harder to visualise the end product as it goes on
	* Can serve as a check in identifying missing or conflicting requirements
* **Not the formal verification and validation program that is performed on the final product**
	* Rather, it is a methodical run through ensuring that the concepts that are being developed are able to meet the likely requirements and expectations of the stakeholders.

# Phase A
* The recursive use of the SE engine is continued
* Concepts and draft key requirements that were developed and validated during pre-phase A are taken and fleshed out
* These become the set of baseline system requirements and ConOps
* Key areas of high risk might be simulated to ensure that the concepts and requirements being developed are good ones
* Identify verification and validation tools and techniques that will be needed in later phases

# Phase B
Te SE engine is applied recursively to:
* Further mature requirements and designs for all products in the developing product tree
* Perform verification and validation of concepts to ensure that the designs are able to meet their requirements
* Operational designs and mission scenarios are evaluated and feasibility of execution within design capabilities and cost estimates are assessed

# Phase C
Again uses the left side of the SE engine to:
* Finalize all requirement updates
* Finalize the ConOps validation
* Develop the final designs to the lowest level of the production tree
* Begin fabrication

# Phase D
Uses the right side of the SE engine to:
* Recursively perform the final implementation, integration, verification and validation of the end product
* Transition the end product to the user at the final pass

# Phases E and F
These are technical management processes that are used to monitor:
* Performance
* Control configuration
* Make decisions associated with the operations, sustaining engineering and closeout of the system
* Any new capabilities or upgrades of the existing system re-enter the SE engine as new developments
