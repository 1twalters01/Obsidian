# Debit and Credit Cards
Key features of both credit and debit cards to consider are as follows:

## Debit vs Credit cards
- Debit cards won't build credit as you are only using your own money.
- Debit cards don't have an annual fee and won't have any rewards unless you have a rewards account.
- Credit cards give you access to a line of credit issued by a bank, while debit cards deduct money directly from your bank account.
- Credit cards offer better consumer protections against fraud compared with debit cards linked to a bank account.
- Credit cards offer may provide additional warranties or insurance on purchased items that go beyond those that the retailer or brand is offering.
- Newer debit cards offer more credit card-like protection, while many credit cards no longer charge annual fees.
- Paying your bill on time and keeping balances on credit cards low can help your [FICO scores](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ficoscore.asp). However, misusing credit cards could hurt your [credit history](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp) if you get into the habit of paying late, max out one or more of your cards, close down older accounts, or apply for new credit too often.
- As a general rule of thumb, the better a credit card’s rewards program is and the more benefits it offers, the higher the annual fee will be.

## Security and Protection
Ensure that your bank takes security seriously. Consider looking for features like biometric ID and deposit protection.

## Online features
* More important for your daily card

## International Services
Features include zero FX (foreign exchange) fees and local IBANs (International bank account number)
* More important for a holiday spending card or for foreign purchases (stocks, items, etc.)
* If dealing with a country a lot (may have a business) you may want a local IBAN. You may not be able to get a bank card in that country as they are often averse to giving them to non-nationals. A lot of banks also don't want to deal with small and medium sized international businesses. Not having one may mean high transactional feel and exchange rates.

## Account type
There are many different account types. Look at [[Types of bank account]] for more information on debit cards and [[Types of credit card]] for more information on credit.

## APR and EAR
Annual percentage rate states the interest accrued if you carried the balance for a full year. It includes fees and charges. EAR is the equivalent annual yield, and it is the interest you would be charged over a year if your account were to remain overdrawn. However, EAR does not include any fees and charges, like APR does.
