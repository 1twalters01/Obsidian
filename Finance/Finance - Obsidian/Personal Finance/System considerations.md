There are many different accounts one should consider having. The ideal type of accounts used for these can vary.

# Current account


# Emergency fund
* money set apart from other savings.
* There to help you deal with unexpected events of life. 
* Should only be used for true emergencies.

## How much to keep
* Keep an amount to cover at least 3 to 6 months of living expenses.
	* These living expenses don't include dining out, entertainment, etc.
	* Look at the basics, such as housing, car, phone, insurance, groceries, credit card minimum payments and basic utilities.
		* Do you own a home or car that continues to need repairs? Engage in activities that could lead to injury? Have other liabilities?
		* Pad the account more if such examples are true.
* Having too much money inside an emergency fund means you are loosing out on interest and growth
	* Your emergency savings could lose some of its value in real terms over time due to inflation.

## Where to store it
* Do not use debt - get out of debt first
* Do not invest your emergency fund
	* Job loss is a common use for emergency funds
	* The markets could crash when you need it as they are correlated with recessions
* Do not put it in a fixed account that cannot be easily accessed
	* Aim to be able to get hold of it within a maximum of 72 hours
* Make sure it is held in institutions (ideally more than one) covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)
	* If you already have savings close to the value of Â£85,000, Split your emergency fund between more than one provider so the protection still applies.
* Aim to choose an account that allows you to immediately access your money, such as:
	* Current accounts
	* Instant-access savings accounts
	* Cash ISAs
* Review your emergency fund at least annually as lifestyle tends to creep as salaries rise.
