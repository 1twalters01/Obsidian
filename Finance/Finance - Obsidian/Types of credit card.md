Bear in mind that there can be fees and charges for application, replacement or inactivity – it varies by provider – and there may be upper limits on spending and withdrawals.

# Reward cards
* Typically, give you a certain number of points or a percentage of what you spend back to you each time you use it.
* Some cards reward you for spending in certain sectors, such as travel, and others for buying certain things, such as groceries.
* There are several types of reward credit cards available, tailored to appeal to different people. The main ones are:
	* Cashback credit cards
	* Travel and air mile credit cards
	* General points credit cards
	* Retail reward credit cards
* Who are they right for people:
	* With a good or perfect credit rating
	* Carry no balance from month to month
	* Be a frequent traveller
	* Be brand loyal
* Pros
	* Earn rewards, air miles, points and cashback just for doing your everyday shopping.
	* Qualify for added rewards, services and bonuses with co-branded cards.
	* Managed well and used responsibly, reward cards can provide you with hundreds of pounds of freebies every year.
* Cons
	* Many reward cards come with an annual fee that could outweigh the benefits if you’re not earning enough reward.
	* High interest rates can cost you more than you get in reward if you don’t pay the card back in full each month.
	* Reward values can appear higher than they actually are - check the fine print

# Credit builder cards
* Typically have low credit limits and high interest rates, as they’re designed for people who’re seen as high risk.
* Paying the monthly bill on time and in full can show lenders you’re reliable, helping you get better credit offers in the future.
* Credit builder cards are useful if you’ve found it hard to get a credit card for various reasons, like:
	* You have a poor credit history and a low credit score
	* You haven’t had time to build up a credit record yet and there isn’t much for lenders to judge you on, for example if you’re new to the UK, if you’re a first-time card-holder or you’ve just turned 18.
	* Your income or employment status is not strong enough to get the credit card you want.

# Balance transfer cards
Transferring a balance from one credit card to another can affect your score – but whether the effect is positive or negative depends on several factors:
* You may decide to cancel your other cards after transferring your balance, as having too much available credit can look bad to lenders.
	* This may reduce your score in the short-term, since lenders typically like to see old, well-managed accounts in your credit history.
	*  A 0% balance transfer card can help you save money on interest, and you can use these savings to pay off what you owe quicker.
	* Increasing your available credit, so that you use a smaller proportion of it, can improve your score.
* When you first get a balance transfer card, you’ll normally have to pay a fee to the provider. This tends to be 2-3% of the balance you’ve transferred, but it can be higher, especially if the promotional period is quite long.
* If you get a balance transfer card, try to pay back at least the minimum amount required each month. Otherwise, you may lose the promotional rate, which could end up making things more expensive.
	* After the 0% promotional period finishes, you'll start being charged interest at the card's standard rate.
* Be wary of spending money with your balance transfer card. It’s often the case that the 0% rate is only applied to balance transfers, and not to new debt created on the balance transfer card. If you want to use your card for both balance transfer and purchases, you could consider getting a dual credit card.
* When applying for a card, keep in mind that lenders reserve the right to offer you an interest rate that’s different to the one advertised. Many banks now offer 0% balance transfer cards, but those with the longest promotional periods may not be available to everyone.
* The maximum amount you can transfer is normally up to 90% of your credit limit – so if your credit limit is £2,000, the most you can transfer over is £1,800.
* There tends to be a time limit for transferring balances at 0% – typically you have between 60 to 90 days.
* If you have a ‘Poor’ or ‘Very Poor’ Experian Credit Score, for example, you may get:
	* **A smaller 0% length** (for example, nine months instead of 18 months)
	* **A smaller credit limit** (the amount of debt you can put onto the card)
	* **A higher APR** (the interest rate you’ll pay if you haven’t cleared the card or shifted the debt before the 0% period ends)
* Once your debts have been moved, you’ll need to decide what to do with your old cards, as these won’t be cancelled automatically.
	* Be aware, too, that the balance on your old card may not be zero – even if you’ve transferred all your debt to your new balance transfer card. How can this be the case? It’s because of something called ‘residual interest’ (also sometimes called ‘trailing interest’).
	* This is the interest that builds up between the date of your billing statement, and the date you paid the balance off ‘in full’. (It helps to remember that interest is usually calculated daily – so you still owe those days of interest that have been added between the day your statement was printed and when you paid off the balance).

# Purchase cards
* In general, credit card rates often vary from 5% to over 30%.
* You can spend money on a 0% purchase card without having to pay interest for a certain period of time - this could be for as little as three months or over 20 months.
* They usually offer a 0% promotional rate for things you buy instore or online – but they may charge a different rate for other kinds of transactions, such as cash withdrawals.
* You’ll need to stick to the credit limit and make the minimum monthly payments on time and in full, or you may lose the promotional rate early.
* May be useful for people who want to spread the cost of a large purchase over several months.
* Common purchases made on a purchase credit card may include:
	* Home improvement costs, such as extensions or renovations
	* Holiday costs, such as flights and hotel bookings
	* Big events, such as weddings, bar mitzvahs and birthday parties
	* Upgrading your car

# Balance transfer and purchase cards
* Offers you the benefits of two types of cards, which could help you save money on both purchase and balance transfers.
* It’s common for them to offer 0% interest rates on both balance transfers and purchases for an introductory period, which could last up to 25 months.
* Combining debt from a number of cards can make it easier to see exactly how much you owe, and a 0% interest rate could help you pay it off faster.
* Look out for the balance transfer fee. You’ll be charged a percentage of your balance when you transfer debt from another card (or cards) on to the dual card.
* Consider whether taking out a separate balance transfer card and purchase card makes more financial sense.
	* You may be able to get longer term promotional deals with single cards.
	* This will include two applications and two new accounts, which could have a negative impact on your credit score.

# Travel credit cards
* Typically designed to make it cheaper for you to spend money overseas – and some may even reward you for travelling.
* Most credit and debit cards will charge you a fee for making purchases or withdrawing cash abroad, and may not offer a good exchange rate.
* Travel credit cards usually don’t charge a fee for use overseas – and they often offer excellent exchange rates.
* They may charge higher interest rates, but as long as you pay the balance off in full and on time each month, they can be an ideal option for holidays – or even for buying from foreign websites.
* key points to consider:
	* Standard credit and debit cards often charge a ‘load fee’ of around 3% per transaction if you use them abroad – that’s an extra £3 for every £100 you spend. The best travel cards won’t charge you for making purchases overseas.
	* Travel credit cards typically don’t charge for overseas ATM cash withdrawals – whereas a standard credit card or debit card usually takes around 2-3% for each withdrawal.
	* When paying by card abroad, always choose to pay in local currency rather than sterling. It means that your bank will do the conversion for you, and if you have a travel credit card you will get the best possible exchange rate.
	* Travel cards are great for spending, but they tend to come with a high, and rarely come with introductory 0% purchase rate periods. So, try to pay the monthly bill in full and on time, to avoid high interest charges.
* Whether a travel credit card is right for you really depends on your needs and preferences. Some alternatives include:
	* Air miles credit cards - discounts for flights, hotels and other travel costs. Examples include British Airways Avios, and Virgin White and Black.
	* Debit cards
		* A few debit cards allow fee-free spending and withdrawals worldwide – but to do that you would need to move your current account, which may be too far just for a holiday.
		* Remember, if things go wrong (e.g. your flights are cancelled) or there’s a dispute, credit cards generally give you more protection than debit cards.
	* Currency (or travel money) cards - Prepaid cards withBear in mind that there can be fees and charges for application, replacement or inactivity – it varies by provider – and there may be upper limits on spending and withdrawals. no additional fees to pay once you’re abroad, and some currency cards will allow you to lock the exchange rate when you load it.
