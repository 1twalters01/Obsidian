## Numeric Operations
Python supports the basic mathematical operations you would expect for numbers.

```python
# addition
sum = 5 + 10
	
# subtraction
difference = 95.5 - 4.3

# multiplication
product = 4 * 30
	
# powers
2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7

# division
quotient = 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float (= 5.66666667)
quotient = 17 // 3 # floor division discards the fractional part (= 5)
	
# remainder
remainder = 43 % 5
```
