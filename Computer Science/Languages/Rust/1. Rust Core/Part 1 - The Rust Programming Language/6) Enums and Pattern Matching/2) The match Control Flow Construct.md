`match` allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of:
* literal values
* variable names
* wildcards
* many other things
Chapter 18 covers all the different kinds of patterns and what they do.

The power of `match` comes from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are handled.




# Patterns that Bind to Values


# Matching Option `<T>`


# Matches Are Exhaustive


# Catch-all Patterns and the `_` Placeholder
